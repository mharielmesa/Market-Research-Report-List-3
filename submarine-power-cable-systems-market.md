<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Power Cable Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core Cable</li><li>Multicore Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submarine power cable systems can be categorized into two main types: single core cable and multicore cable. Single core cables have one insulated conductor, making them suitable for high voltage transmission. Multicore cables, on the other hand, consist of multiple insulated conductors within the same sheath, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals or power sources. Both types of cables are used in underwater environments to transmit electricity over long distances efficiently and safely.</p></p>
