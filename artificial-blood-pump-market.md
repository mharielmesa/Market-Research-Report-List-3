<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Blood Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volumetric</li><li>Vane Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial Blood Pump market consists of two main types - Volumetric and Vane Type pumps. Volumetric pumps operate by moving a fixed volume of blood through the pump with each cycle, providing a continuous and consistent flow. On the other hand, Vane Type pumps use rotating vanes to suck blood into the pump and then push it out into the circulatory system. Both types are crucial in providing support for patients with heart failure or other cardiac conditions, ensuring proper blood circulation and oxygen delivery.</p></p>
