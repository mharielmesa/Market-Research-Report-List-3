<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRI System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed MRI Systems</li><li>Open MRI Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MRI systems are classified into two main types: closed and open systems. Closed MRI systems have a tunnel-like structure that patients lay inside during the scan, providing high-quality images but potentially causing discomfort for those with claustrophobia. Open MRI systems have a more spacious design, offering a more comfortable experience for patients while still producing clear images. Both types cater to different patient needs and preferences, contributing to the diversity within the MRI system market.</p></p>
