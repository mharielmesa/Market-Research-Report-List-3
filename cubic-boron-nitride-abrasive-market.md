<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cubic Boron Nitride Abrasive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBN Monocrystalline</li><li>CBN Micro Mist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) abrasives are available in two main types: CBN Monocrystalline and CBN Micro Mist. CBN Monocrystalline abrasive consists of large single crystals that provide high wear resistance and thermal stability, making it ideal for cutting and grinding hard materials. On the other hand, CBN Micro Mist abrasive is created by breaking down larger crystals into smaller particles, resulting in a fine powder that is suitable for polishing and finishing applications. Both types offer efficient cutting performance and long tool life.</p></p>
