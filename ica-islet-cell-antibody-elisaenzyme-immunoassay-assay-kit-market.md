<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICA Islet Cell Antibody ELISAEnzyme immunoassay Assay Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Competition ELISA</li><li>Sandwich ELISA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICA Islet Cell Antibody ELISA is a type of enzyme immunoassay kit used to detect the presence of islet cell antibodies in serum samples. Competition ELISA and Sandwich ELISA are two types of markets in the enzyme immunoassay industry. Competition ELISA measures the competition between the antigen in the sample and a labeled antigen for binding sites on the antibody. On the other hand, in Sandwich ELISA, the antigen is captured between two layers of antibodies. These different market types cater to specific needs in the field of immunoassays.</p></p>
