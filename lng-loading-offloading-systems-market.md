<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Loading & Offloading Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring)</li><li>SPM (Single Point Mooring)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LNG Loading & Offloading Systems market offers two main types of systems - Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) and Single Point Mooring (SPM). CBM typically involves a buoy anchored to the seabed, allowing the LNG carrier to moor alongside it for loading or offloading. On the other hand, SPM involves a single point mooring system where the LNG carrier is connected to a buoy that is anchored to the seabed by a mooring line. Both systems are commonly used in the LNG industry for efficient loading and offloading operations.</p></p>
