<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venoarterial (VA)</li><li>Venovenous (VV)</li><li>Arteriovenous (AV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Machine Market includes three main types: Venoarterial (VA), Venovenous (VV), and Arteriovenous (AV) ECMO. Venoarterial ECMO provides cardiac and respiratory support by draining blood from the right atrium and returning oxygenated blood to the aorta. Venovenous ECMO supports only the respiratory system by removing deoxygenated blood from the vena cava and returning oxygenated blood to the same vein. Arteriovenous ECMO bypasses the heart and lungs by extracting blood from an artery and returning it to a vein.</p></p>
