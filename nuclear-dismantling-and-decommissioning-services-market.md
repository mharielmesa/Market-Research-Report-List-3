<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Dismantling and Decommissioning Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immediate Dismantling & Decommissioning</li><li>Deferred Dismantling & Decommissioning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Immediate dismantling and decommissioning services involve the immediate shutdown, dismantling, and removal of nuclear facilities once they are no longer operational. This approach is preferred by many due to its promptness and cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, deferred dismantling and decommissioning services involve postponing the dismantling process until a later date. This allows for radioactive decay to reduce the level of radioactivity, making the dismantling process safer and more manageable. Each approach has its own advantages and considerations for nuclear facility owners.</p></p>
