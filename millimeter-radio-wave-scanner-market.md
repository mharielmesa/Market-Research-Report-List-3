<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Millimeter Radio-Wave Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Scanner</li><li>Active Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Millimeter radio-wave scanners can be categorized into two main types: passive scanners and active scanners. Passive scanners do not emit any radio waves, instead they detect and analyze signals already present in the environment. Active scanners, on the other hand, emit radio waves which bounce off objects and are then detected by the scanner. Passive scanners are preferred for their non-invasive nature, while active scanners are used for applications requiring more precise detection and measurement capabilities.</p></p>
