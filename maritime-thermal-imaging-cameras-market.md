<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Maritime Thermal Imaging Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled Type</li><li>Cooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Maritime thermal imaging cameras come in two main types: uncooled and cooled. Uncooled cameras utilize sensors that do not require cryogenic cooling, making them more cost-effective and energy-efficient. They are suitable for short to medium range applications. Cooled cameras, on the other hand, use a cooling system to enhance image quality and sensitivity, making them ideal for long-range surveillance and detection tasks. They are generally more expensive and require more maintenance compared to uncooled cameras.</p></p>
