<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Pyrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Refraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation pyrometers are devices used to measure high temperatures by detecting the amount of infrared radiation emitted by an object. There are two main types of radiation pyrometers: reflective type and refraction type. Reflective type pyrometers use a mirror to reflect the infrared radiation onto a detector, while refraction type pyrometers use a lens to focus the radiation onto the detector. Both types are commonly used in industrial settings to measure the temperature of objects such as furnaces, engines, and machinery.</p></p>
