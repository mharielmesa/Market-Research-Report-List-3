<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PI Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PI fibers are produced through two main spinning methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. In wet spinning, the polymer solution is extruded into a coagulation bath to solidify the fibers. This method is more commonly used for producing high-performance PI fibers with superior strength and elasticity. On the other hand, dry spinning involves evaporating the solvent from the polymer solution to form solid fibers. This method is often used to produce PI fibers for more conventional applications where high mechanical properties are not required.</p></p>
