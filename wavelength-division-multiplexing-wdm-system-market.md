<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coarse Wavelength-division Multiplexing (CWDM)</li><li>Dense Wavelength-division Multiplexing (DWDM).</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems allow multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of light. There are two main types of WDM systems: Coarse Wavelength-division Multiplexing (CWDM) which uses wider wavelength spacing for fewer channels, and Dense Wavelength-division Multiplexing (DWDM) which uses closer wavelength spacing for higher channel capacity. CWDM is more cost-effective for shorter distances, while DWDM is better suited for long-haul and high-capacity applications. Both types play crucial roles in meeting increasing bandwidth demands in telecommunications networks.</p></p>
