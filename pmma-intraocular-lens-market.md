<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PMMA Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PMMA Intraocular Lenses are commonly categorized into two types based on their material properties: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic lenses have a high water content and tend to attract water molecules, making them more flexible and allowing for easier manipulation during surgery. On the other hand, hydrophobic lenses repel water and are more durable, with a lower risk of protein deposits and inflammation. Each type of lens has its own advantages and suitability for different patients depending on their individual needs.</p></p>
