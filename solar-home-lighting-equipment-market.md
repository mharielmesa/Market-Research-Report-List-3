<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar home lighting equipment market can be broadly categorized into two types: Off-grid solar and grid-tied solar. Off-grid solar systems are independent, self-sufficient systems that generate and store electricity on-site without being connected to the main power grid. On the other hand, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the main power grid, allowing excess solar power to be fed back into the grid. Both types of systems have their own advantages and are gaining popularity as sustainable and cost-effective solutions for residential lighting needs.</p></p>
