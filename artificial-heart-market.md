<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Heart market consists of two main types: Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) and Total Artificial Heart. VADs are mechanical pumps that support heart function by assisting the weakened ventricle in pumping blood throughout the body. Total Artificial Hearts, on the other hand, replace the entire heart and pump blood like a natural heart would. Both types of Artificial Hearts are used in patients with severe heart failure or other cardiac conditions to improve heart function and overall quality of life.</p></p>
