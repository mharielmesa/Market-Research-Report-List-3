<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Display Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED</li><li>OLED</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Display Device market is divided into two main types - LED and OLED. LED (Light Emitting Diode) displays use a backlight to illuminate the screen, providing high brightness and energy efficiency. On the other hand, OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) displays do not require a backlight, allowing for thinner and more flexible screens with higher contrast ratios. Both types of displays are commonly used in medical imaging equipment to provide clear and accurate visualization of medical images.</p></p>
