<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AR Coated Ball Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Layer Coating</li><li>Multilayer Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Layer Coating in AR coated ball lenses market refers to a thin optical coating applied to the surface of the lens to reduce reflection and improve light transmission. This type of coating is simple and cost-effective but may not provide as much anti-reflective performance as Multilayer Coating. Multilayer Coating, on the other hand, consists of several layers of different materials with varying refractive indices to achieve even higher anti-reflective properties and better overall performance in the market.</p></p>
