<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multiple Orifice Flow Control Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multiple orifice flow control valves are available in two main market types: manual and automatic. Manual valves require human intervention to adjust the flow rate, usually through the use of a handle or knob. On the other hand, automatic valves are equipped with sensors and actuators that adjust the flow rate based on predetermined settings or real-time conditions. Both types offer precise control over flow rates, with manual valves being more cost-effective and simple to use, while automatic valves offer greater convenience and accuracy.</p></p>
